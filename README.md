Bukkit/Spigot mod for tracking each passing day and dividing the time into days of the week and months of the year and triggering special events in game


We will later come up with special features for the months and years, but the main pitch that LadyDeath360 (http://www.minecraftforum.net/) worked out is the days of the week which would have the following names and follow a given rule:

- Monsoonday: It rains all day
- Earthday: Bonus crops granted upon harvest
- Wortag: Bonus netherwart granted upon harvest
- Donnerstag: Lightning will strike in your vicinity all day
- Fishfryday: Double XP fishing all day with the chance of bonus rewards
- Diamonday: Bonus diamonds dropped when mining diamond ore
- Feathersday: No fall. damage all day


Version 1.0.0 will track the days of the week and inform the user when the day changes. When the day changes the, special features for that day become active, as described below (now more explicitly than ever!)

Please note, this plugin has no commands. After you place the jar in your plugin folder, there is no more interaction required. The special features for each day are pretty self explanatory, but I will go into great detail below:

- Monsoonday: It rains all day. This is the first day of the 7 day week. On this day, it rains for the entire day. You will get wet. That is all.

- Earthday: Bonus crops granted upon harvest. When you pick a ripe potato, carrot or wheat on this day, you will be rewarded with an extra 1-3 crops.

- Wortag: Bonus netherwart granted upon harvest. When you pick a ripe netherwart on this day, you will be rewarded with an extra 1-3 netherwart.

- Donnerstag: Lightning will strike in your vicinity all day. Every 5 seconds, there is a 50% chance that lightning will strike within 0-15 blocks in the X direction and 0-15 blocks in the Z direction. Be careful. You may want to stay indoors on this day.

- Fishfryday: Double XP fishing all day with the chance of bonus rewards. You will get double XP with everything you catch. There is a 10% chance your catch will include an emerald. There is a 1% chance that it will include a diamond. You should fish on this day.

- Diamonday: Bonus diamonds dropped when mining diamond ore. On this day, every time you mine a diamond ore (not with silk touch), you will recieve 1-2 extra diamonds. You are welcome.

- Feathersday: No fall damage all day. No matter how far you fall on this day, you will not take fall damage. That is fun.
